# SMS-based-Notification-system
Notification-System is a project which will help faculty to intimidate students about any important information like Schedule Changes, any upcoming seminar and other information. This information will be shared through SMS. Through other platforms like whatsapp, sometimes information got missed due to network gliches or any else reason, due to which we adopted SMS for message sharing This is built on django framework along with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as front-end framework Along with this, we will be using Celery and Redis for task scheduling involved in it.
